# Wizard War
Wizard War is a Roguelike dungeon crawler game that simulates battling your way through a magic castle full of hostile wizards. The player controls a wizard character that traverses through the map and can encounter two enemy wizards. Encountering each enemy wizard triggers turn-based combat in which the player must choose the appropriate spell to defeat the enemy based on the enemy type. The aim is for the player to defeat both wizards present on the map and “conquer the castle.” The player loses when the wrong spell is chosen to defeat the particular enemy type.

## What I Learned
- Embedded System Design Principles ([Design Documentation](https://github.com/emilyhix/WizardWar/wiki/Design-Documentation))
- Timer Interrupt Handling
- SPI Communication Protocols
- GPIO, ADC/DAC
- Low-level communication with the ST7735 LCD display without the use of a library
